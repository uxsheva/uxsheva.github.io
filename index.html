						<p>I help businesses grow, increase revenues, decrease costs, and
communicate business values by ensuring that customers get
great experience at every interaction with the product.</p>
<ul>Here is how I do it:

do and why;</li>
<li>prepare user journey maps, wireframes, prototypes, etc;</li>
<li>facilitate collaboration, knowledge and idea sharing in the
team.</li></ul>
<p>My job is to provide the highest standard of
communication between the business and its customers at
every touchpoint in order to enable the user to achieve their
goal using the product.</p>
